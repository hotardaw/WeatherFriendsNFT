1. Make basic ERC721 WeatherFriends minting shell contract
2. Integrate Accuweather Chainlink oracle into dynamic art that changes with real-world weather conditions (possibly only when staked)
3. Add a WeatherFriends staking contract to enable art changes/token emissions (token emissions possibly revolving around certain weather conditions)
